<p>So looks like I finally found a blogging engine and format I like. I&#8217;ve used all the popular hosted solutions over the years, from Wordpress to Tumblr and Posterous, and even though I&#8217;ve seen the benefits and convenience of all three, at heart I&#8217;m a hacker and wanted a lightweight solution totally under my control. I toyed with a combination of open source technologies before settling on this - the <a href='http://octopress.org'>Octopress</a> framework for the <a href='https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll'>Jekyll</a> blogging engine. Written in <a href='http://ruby-lang.org'>Ruby</a>, a Japanese programming language optimised for happiness and, as I&#8217;ve mentioned before, a language that attracts me for all the wrong reasons, technically speaking. I love the aesthetic, the vibe, and the impossibly hip culture. A computer programming language that attacks the literary cortex.</p>

<p>The blog is given wings by <a href='http://gitscm.org'>git</a>, a distributed version control system. For me this is a critical part of the machine. It means I can clone the blog, reproduce it anywhere and reanimate it if the current hosting platform (the spellbinding <a href='http://heroku.com'>heroku</a>) goes away.</p>

<p>This also means that contributions for now are handled in a rather geeky way. If you want to contribute, fork the blog on <a href='https://github.com/buddhamagnet/kaleidopunk'>github</a> and issue a pull request. Trust me, git is worth knowing for reasons far beyond geek. It gives your content legs.</p>

<p>So this is my blog in it&#8217;s fourth or fifth mutation. A kaleidopunk manifesto. A place for me to explore books, words, hacker culture, stories and sounds. I promise I&#8217;ll stop banging on about the technology for now.</p>
