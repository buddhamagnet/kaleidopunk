<p>I have had the good fortune to provide coding hands on and off for the last few weeks for <a href='http://unbound.co.uk'>unbound</a>, a wonderful idea, kind of like kickstarter for books but with so much more going on from the initial book pitch right up to printing, binding and delivery. Great people with a great vision. On Monday September 12th I&#8217;ll be popping along to their 5 X 15 event at <a href='http://www.tabernaclew11.com'>The Tabernacle</a>, which should be a wordy hoot.</p>
