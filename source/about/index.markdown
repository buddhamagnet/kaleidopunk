'I believe that magic is art, and that art, whether that be music, writing, sculpture, or any other form, is literally magic. Art is, like magic, the science of manipulating symbols, words or images, to achieve changes in consciousness...Indeed to cast a spell is simply to spell, to manipulate words, to change people's consciousness, and this is why I believe that an artist or writer is the closest thing in the contemporary world to a shaman.'

That's from Alan Moore, and it's a pretty accurate description of how I view the word dimension. 

I'm inspired and motivated by many people - not just writers and but also musicians, painters, comic book artists, computer programmers, bloggers and the mascara snakes of the avant garde. I sense the resonating force in words and their unparalleled power in the human world.

This site is dedicated to my tilted affair with language.
