My name is Dave Goodchild. I call myself a word engineer. My favourite quote at the moment is from Alan Moore:

'I believe that magic is art, and that art, whether that be music, writing, sculpture, or any other form, is literally magic. Art is, like magic, the science of manipulating symbols, words or images, to achieve changes in consciousnessâ€¦ Indeed to cast a spell is simply to spell, to manipulate words, to change people's consciousness, and this is why I believe that an artist or writer is the closest thing in the contemporary world to a shaman.'

On the word front, I am influenced by many, many people - not just writers and but also musicians, painters, comic book artists, computer programmers, bloggers and the mascara snakes of the avant garde. I sense the resonating force in words and their unparalleled power in the human world.

As a developer, I have my head in two camps. I employ Drupal to build community engines fast (at the moment I am freelancing at The Economist) and I love Ruby. I primarily develop web applications using Rails and Sinatra and was responsible for assisting in the very first rubyinthepub, a hookup for journalists and developers which has since mutated into the successful UK arm of hackshackers, with attendees from the Times, Guardian and New York Times. Recent projects I have been involved in have been featured on BBC Click, BBC Outriders and over at journalism.co.uk. I am also currently contributing code to the diaspora project, blogging in octopress, and building some gems. I am also on the verge of working with Jeff Noon.
