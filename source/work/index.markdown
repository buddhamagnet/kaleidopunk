Here's a list of the things I have worked on or built recently:

RUBY

2011-2012 [Unbound](http://unbound.co.uk)

Freelancing on Rails 3 build for UK startup revolving around online patronage of published and unpublished writers. The site has generated a fair amount of press.

I have been involved in all aspects of the project from refactoring the original code provided by an agency, upgrading the application to Rails 3.1, introducing testing, advising on version control methodologies and development workflow, as well as day-to-day coding.

2011-2012 [Diaspora](http://joindiaspora.org)

2011 [Lovefresh](http:/lovefre.sh) 

Freelanced for a UK startup specialising in linking producers of fresh local food with consumers. Helped build the Rails component of their platform which also incorporates an iPhone app.

Technology: built in Rails 2.3.8 (upgrading to 3 soon) using TDD/BDD (Rspec/Webrat) and HAML on the templating side. Full HTML5 interface including audio elements.

DRUPAL

2011 [The Economist](http://www.economist.com)

Current daytime role working as part of the London team for Economist Online. Larger distributed team includes a development unit from Hungary based in the London office and teams in New York and Austin Texas.

This is a team running a finely tuned agile methodology with code reviews, unit testing and continuous integration. I'm on the SWAT team which is responsible for ongoing maintenance and delivery of new features on the Economist website. From a Drupal perspective, development is on the cutting edge, making extensive use of Drush and Features for automation and deployment on the Pressflow distribution.

2010-2011 Turner Broadcasting:

Worked as a freelance Drupal developer on a range of international media sites - mainly build and maintenance of custom modules running on Pressflow.

[Adult Swim](http://adultswim.com) (where I encountered the singular Aqua Teen Hunger Force).

2010 [Comic Relief](http://comicrelief.co.uk)

Worked as a freelance developer on the Sport Relief 2010 campaign from start to finish, culminating with the live event itself (providing support from BT Tower). Built custom modules for the Drupal site and was instrumental in rebuilding the web services layer which provided a back end for the donation system and the childrens and project maps sections (Flash front end, back end AMF).
