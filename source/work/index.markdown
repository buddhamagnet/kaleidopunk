WORK
Here it comes, a list of the things I have worked on or built recently:

RUBY

2011 Unbound

Freelancing on Rails 3 build for UK startup revolving around online patronage of published and unpublished writers. The site has generated a fair amount of press.

I have been involved in all aspects of the project from refactoring the original code provided by an agency, upgrading the application to Rails 3.1, introducing testing, advising on version control methodologies and development workflow, as well as day-to-day coding.

2011 Diaspora

Contributing back to this open source project when I can and now also hosting a pod.

2011 Nanowrimo

Assisting in the migration from Drupal to Rails for National Novel Writing Month 2011. Work involves dipping in to both technology stacks. 

2011 Help Me Investigate

Currently in the process of converting this Channel 4-funded journalism site from Rails 2.3.2 all the way up to 3.0.7 and breathing new life into the application, the brainchild of journalist and blogger Paul Bradshaw.

2011 Lovefresh 

Freelanced for a UK startup specialising in linking producers of fresh local food with consumers. Helped build the Rails component of their platform which also incorporates an iPhone app.

Technology: built in Rails 2.3.8 (upgrading to 3 soon) using TDD/BDD (Rspec/Webrat) and HAML on the templating side. Full HTML5 interface including audio elements.

DRUPAL

2011 The Economist

Current daytime role working as part of the London team for Economist Online. Larger distributed team includes a development unit from Hungary based in the London office and teams in New York and Austin Texas.

This is a team running a finely tuned agile methodology with code reviews, unit testing and continuous integration. I'm on the SWAT team which is responsible for ongoing maintenance and delivery of new features on the Economist website. From a Drupal perspective, development is on the cutting edge, making extensive use of Drush and Features for automation and deployment on the Pressflow distribution.

2010-2011 Turner Broadcasting:

Worked as a freelance Drupal developer on a range of international media sites - mainly build and maintenance of custom modules running on Pressflow.

Cartoon Network
Boomerang
Adult Swim (where I encountered the singular Aqua Teen Hunger Force).

2010 Comic Relief

Worked as a freelance developer on the Sport Relief 2010 campaign from start to finish, culminating with the live event itself (providing support from BT Tower). Built custom modules for the Drupal site and was instrumental in rebuilding the web services layer which provided a back end for the donation system and the childrens and project maps sections (Flash front end, back end AMF).

PERSONAL PROJECTS

2005 - 2009 Jellyfish Online Marketing

Involved in rebuild of entire company platform from a stew of table-based magazine subscription sites without version control or proper development methodologies into a new platform incorporating sites built using MVC (specifically Codeigniter), version control (svn with branching and merging), agile methodology (Scrum), code reviews and pair programming.
