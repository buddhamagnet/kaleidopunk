I returned from a family trip to Spain last week and as I bleared my way through Gatwick
at 2 a.m. I bumped into Ian Hislop. It's always a little hallucinogenic seeing a well-known
face in the flesh, even more so at that kind of hour. It messes with your face recognition
wetware. Ian was standing, looking a little nervous, listening to his driver drone on about
the varying degrees of fascism exhibited by police forces across the land. 

The encounter had another effect on me. I am growing increasingly media-sick, tired of
sensationalism, bad reporting, rampant corruption and crass commercialism and the relegation
of many forms of journalism and analysis to branches of the entertainment industry. And it
struck me that there is a cure. Not to turn everything off and disconnect. But just be aware
that media, if not arbiters of truth, are illusory, static. Watching this nervous and tired
man in the skin, contrasting it with the images and sounds of biting satire and wit I have
observed through TV, I realise that I put far too much store in modern media and the cave
projections it throws up in my head.

It's dew on grass, bubbles and mind pop. All I really need to do is listen deep to the workings
of my heart. The only booming voice I should heed is that of the word demon that drives me. If
I care for people, connect hard and produce human product with use and value every day, all is well.
