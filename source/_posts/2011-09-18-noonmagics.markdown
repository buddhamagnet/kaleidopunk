I love synchronicity. I've been planning a website devoted to word experiments for some time. 
Walking in the park today, I suddenly thought of Jeff Noon, the author of Vurt and other weird
and wonderful fictions and the [Cobralingus](http://www.metamorphiction.com/index.php/printed/cobralingus/) experiment. I decided to get in touch with Jeff to
see whether he wanted to get involved and did a quick search for his name on Twitter. The third
tweet I saw was by [Colin Wilson](http://twitter.com/furiousgecko) saying that [Jeff](http://twitter.com/jeffnoon) had suddenly appeared on Twitter. Today. My
heart skipped a beat. The internal structure of the universe is strange and powerful, and 
sometimes the surface is so thin we can travel space, time and mind in an instant. It's 
palpable.
