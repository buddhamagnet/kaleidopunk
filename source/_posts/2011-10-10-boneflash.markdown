I have been consumed of late by a strange force. Increasingly sad about the human race and its reckless and damaging actions, I'm feeling deep and wide. It's not despair, even though it makes my heart heavy.
I guess it's a sadness that people can't seem to realise how endless and powerful the cosmos is. That we spend so much time either engaged in fruitless and trivial pursuits, controlled by
our tools and distracted by posion static, or hurting one another. I was on the train this morning, utterly calm and trying to hold on to that feeling as I approached the city, and for
a second I saw people lit up, illuiminated in a green flash, could see their bones and blood, pumping and cracking, all cast from the same mould but sundered and alone.

I'm not a flake. But I've been thinking more and more about British visionaries like Blake, connecting hard with history and the ancient history our culture is built on. Yes it was bloody
and ignorant for the most part, but somewhere along the way, as we've evolved our technology and science, we've lost a fundamental conduit to the primal and eternal. I'm bringing that back
online in my own life to the best of my ability. In bushcraft, in strong connections with people, in a keen awareness of the wild and tribal. And not in a hippie sense. It's the only way
our demented and broken species will survive.
