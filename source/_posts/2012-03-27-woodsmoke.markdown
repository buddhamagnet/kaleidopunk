It's been a while. A staggering 4 months or so since I posted anything. But I just can't do it if I'm paralysed. Sure, I can talk, drink,
rant. But to shore my soul in words, even something as ephemeral and transient as a blog post, requires some commitment. Words are precious
and should be driven by the soul as it moves.

So I just got back from the inaugural weekend of the Woodlander - a two year course in bushcraft and survival skills run by the
eminently professional and deeply knowledgeable guys at [woodland-ways.co.uk](http://woodland-ways.co.uk). The first three day slot
was devoted to knives, axes, splitting and carving. Being a somewhat clumsy being in the physical dimension I found it challenging in 
the main but it wasn't until I got home that the lazy drip drip of osmosis began to foreground the real lessons of the experience and 
inspire me to emit words.

I lost track of time. I sat around a fire with grown men who sought an extra dimension and witnessed the bullshit evaporate with rapid
emotional effect. I slept under the stars, stunned with wonder. I resorted to nature for light, heat, resource. I remembered an unspoken
language. And, above all, I felt my way blind towards the tail end of a tribal magic long since forgotten, buried beneath elevators and 
streets...
