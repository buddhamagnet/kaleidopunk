I have had the good fortune to provide coding hands on and off for the last few weeks for [unbound](http://unbound.co.uk),
a wonderful idea, kind of like kickstarter for books but with so much more going on from the initial book pitch right
up to printing, binding and delivery. Great people with a great vision. On Monday September 12th I'll be popping along to
their 5 X 15 event at [The Tabernacle](http://www.tabernaclew11.com), which should be a wordy hoot.
