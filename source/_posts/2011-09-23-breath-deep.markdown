I was reading Pablo Neruda on the train in today. That kind of grasp of language, that totality of vision, terrify and enthrall me. But I
know something. Sometimes (a lot of the time) I find it hard to write words. I'm lazy. I don't trust the magnetic currents that drive me.
I need to surrender more and worry less. Even when I don't get there, I have a keen awareness that I'm part of an endless, blazing continuum
of writers and poets. Luminous souls. People who fought, and fight, the debasement of the word and the degradation of the spirit. Sometimes
I can almost touch them, and sometimes when that current is flowing freely, the most incredible synchronicity engages and makes the maddest
things manifest.

I need to learn to dive deeper, conserve my oxygen, dive into the depths where strange forms shiver. I need to learn how to hold my breath.
