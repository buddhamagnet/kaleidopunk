So looks like I finally found a blogging engine and format I like. I've used all the popular
hosted solutions over the years, from Wordpress to Tumblr and Posterous, and even though I've
seen the benefits and convenience of all three, at heart I'm a hacker and wanted a lightweight
solution totally under my control. I toyed with a combination of open source technologies before
settling on this - the [Octopress](http://octopress.org) framework for the [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) blogging engine. Written in [Ruby](http://ruby-lang.org), 
a Japanese programming language optimised for happiness and, as I've mentioned before, a language that attracts me for all the wrong reasons, technically speaking. I love the aesthetic, the vibe, and the impossibly hip culture. A computer programming language that attacks the literary cortex.

The blog is given wings by [git](http://gitscm.org), a distributed version control system. For me 
this is a critical part of the machine. It means I can clone the blog, reproduce it anywhere
and reanimate it if the current hosting platform (the spellbinding [heroku](http://heroku.com)) goes away. 

This also means that contributions for now are handled in a rather geeky way. If you want to
contribute, fork the blog on [github](https://github.com/buddhamagnet/kaleidopunk) and issue a 
pull request. Trust me, git is worth knowing for reasons far beyond geek. It gives your content legs.

So this is my blog in it's fourth or fifth mutation. A kaleidopunk manifesto.
