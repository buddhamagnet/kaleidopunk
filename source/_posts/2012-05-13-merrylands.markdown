Me and the brood took off camping in the new tent a week or so back. We ended up at Merrylands campsite
in East Sussex. Minimal and wild with an eco-toilet and open campfires. My kind of camping. The ground
was a bog due to the rain and the warm and friendly owners took our gear down to the site in a trailer
and brought logs and kindling down in the evenings. A slice of magic.
